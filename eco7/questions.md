1.  How do consumers purchases motor oil? 
- There were DIY and DIFM providers for consumers
- Directly or through other retail outlets
- Fast lubes, these were stores that changed the oil very very quickly
- Oil change plus, these were stores that had other stuff and oil as like a plus 
- Repair shops, these were stores that offered mechanic services like tire changes or gasoline sales
- Car dealers, Sale of vehicles
- Mass merchandises and warehoues clubs, DIFM and DIY, shop while they waited basically

2.  Assess Avellin’s position in the PCMO industry, including 
consumer perception and Avellin’s distribution strategy. 
- Consumer perception was associated with the brand and how good the brand was
- Avellin's distribution strategy was to three channels
    - Independent DIFM
    - National retailers
    - AvellinAuto
- Independent DIFM included fast lubes, oil change plus, and repair shops
- National retailers included putting Avellin's products on the shelf of large retailers and for customers that were more DIY
- AvellinAuto were company owned stores or francised-stores that sold avellin products exclusively. Sold directly through a company's
regional distribution centers
- 
3.  What is the strategic role of Eco7? How should Avellin 
weigh consumer interest in, and willingness to pay for, a 
green motor oil? Is it the right product at the right time? 
- Eco7's strategic role is a more eco friendly motor oil
- It appealed to customers that were enviromentally conscious
- Yes it is the right product at the right time, world is dying, global warming lol

4.  What is the right launch strategy for Eco7? 
a) How should Eco7 be priced? What are the profit 
implications for wholesalers and DIFM stores? 
b) How should Eco7 be distributed? What is your 
recommendation regarding exclusivity for Aventage 
stores? 
- a) Eco7 should probably be priced a little higher than the normal oil but not that much
    - Reason being that it takes more to manufacture Eco7 oil, you can appeal the premium/eco-friendly aspect of it with a higher price
- If the profit does well, it will imply that eco friendly motor oil is a promising product
- b) Should be exclusively aventage stores initially and then if it performs very well, sell to retailers but initially, make the aventage stores the only outlet for these products to build a brand / loyalty and see if it does well.
