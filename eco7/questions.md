weigh consumer interest in, and willingness to pay for, a 
green motor oil? Is it the right product at the right time? 
- Eco7's strategic role is a more eco friendly motor oil
- It appealed to customers that were enviromentally conscious
- Yes it is the right product at the right time, world is dying, global warming lol

### Answer online:
The strategic role for the launch of Eco7 is that this motor oil is prepared from recycled oils and it would be environment friendly oil with high quality and an affordable price. This product is planned to be launched by Avellin because of the changing state of the earth and the changing trends of the PCMO market. The trend had changed in the oil market and the consumers were attracted towards environment friendly and more fuel-efficient vehicles. The electric and hybrid gasoline vehicles had the mass-market appeal.

Customers were now interested in fuel efficient vehicles and Avellin had developed Eco7 to support this trend and reduce the carbon emissions. Along with this, the cost for producing Eco7 is much higher than the other motor oils produced by the management, however, the price matches the price for synthetic lubricants and the quality is also much higher. The consumers will therefore, perceive the quality of Eco7 to be higher.

As stated previously, the consumers of the company have become more attracted towards the green motor oil, therefore, the management needs to change the perceptions of the consumers and promote Eco7 as an environment friendly oil. However, the high quality performance of this oil should also be conveyed to the consumers because it would be an important factor for gaining consumersâ€™ interest so that they are willing to buy this oil.

The refining process and the additives gave Eco7 a longevity and a higher performance compared to the synthetic blend. This oil performed better at higher temperatures without breaking down. Normally, vehicles required oil change after 3000 miles but this allowed the oil replacement after 7500 miles for most vehicles. These all factors need to be conveyed to the consumers. Currently, the results of the market test showed that consumers considered the price of $ 6.75 as much higher among the synthetic oils of the company.

However, if we compare Eco7 price with the other environment friendly products in the market, then this was much cheaper motor oil in the market. The results of the research show that the green factor, price and performance were all import for the consumers to pay for Eco7. Finally, the distribution strategy also needs to be created for the company to create the market for Eco 7. This is the right product at the right time because it is the need of time as the market trends have changed significantly and the company has been losing its market share to other competitors. The detailed marketing mix has been created in the next question

4.  What is the right launch strategy for Eco7? 
a) How should Eco7 be priced? What are the profit 
implications for wholesalers and DIFM stores? 
b) How should Eco7 be distributed? What is your 
recommendation regarding exclusivity for Aventage 
stores? 
- a) Eco7 should probably be priced a little higher than the normal oil but not that much
    - Reason being that it takes more to manufacture Eco7 oil, you can appeal the premium/eco-friendly aspect of it with a higher price
- If the profit does well, it will imply that eco friendly motor oil is a promising product
- b) Should be exclusively aventage stores initially and then if it performs very well, sell to retailers but initially, make the aventage stores the only outlet for these products to build a brand / loyalty and see if it does well. 


## Answers online:
1)How do consumer's purchase motor oil?Many consumers viewed motor oil as commodity product. 
Consumer of motor oil fell into 2 broad segments-Do-it-yourself(DIY) and Do-it-for-me (DIFM).

- DIY:Consumers who changed their own motor oil. These consumers purchased PCMO in bottles from mass merchandisers or online. This segment was younger overall than DIFM. They were most likely to purchase their motor oil from mass merchandiser, such as wallmart, or an automotive parts store, such as AutoZone or Advance Auto Parts.

- DIFM:They used professional service providers. This segment was usually older and had higher income.

2)Assess Avellin's position in PCMO industry in terms of consumer perceptions. Describe its distribution strategy.

Position in PCMO industry:oAvellin remains a well-respected, innovative company that customers trust.- oAvellin remain number 3 player in branded motor oil.
- oAvellin is the leading PCMO brand among independent DIFM customers.Among DIFM consumers seeking the best price, Avellin held the strongest position.
- Distribution Strategy:Revenue for Avellincame from 3 key customer types:
- a)Independent DIFM: They are the key features in Avellin’s distribution channels and accounted for 68% of it’s sales. 4400 out of 6000 customers, which accounts for more than 70% of them joined the Aventage program(loyalty program).
- b)National Retailers:They accounted for 9% of Avellin’s PCMO sales. In order to build loyalty among it’s base of DIFM customers, Avellinm had been satisfied to put products on the shelf for the DIY segment.
- c)AvellinAuto:With 436 stores open as of 2014, AvellinAuto chain generated approximately 7% of PCMO sales. AvellinAutostores were serviced directly through the company’s regional distribution centers, rather than through a wholesaler, that’s why the effective manufacturer gross profit was about $0.75 higher per five quarts. 

3) What is the right launch strategy for Eco 7? How it should be priced? What are the profit implications for wholesalers and DIFM stores?

Launch Strategy:
Eco7 should be launched through the AvellinAuto stores and independent DIFM customers in the Aventage program. This launch program will reach the DIFM customer base and since independent DIFM generate a large percentage of revenue, they are key to reach a significant portion of the market. 
Also, Avellin is already a leading PCMO brand among independent DIFM customers, so this target audience is more likely to be receptive to a new product from a brand they already trust.

Pricing:Market is very sensitive to price, and 17% of Avellin’sconsumers are price-oriented (Exhibit 4) so, penetration and sales performance of new oil is dependent on price point. 

The company also estimated different levels of adoption and number of sales for each type of distributor (Exhibit 6). Also, Eco7 is a conventional motor oil, it is estimated that consumer of this type of oil would be first to switch.

By choosing the price for Eco7 at $6.75 per quart the company would have a fewer number of oil changes and lower level of penetration, than it would have at price $5.25. Also a lower price might provide independent DIFM customers a higher margin.

The difference in Avellin’s revenue selling Eco7 instead of Avellin Conventional would be higher for $6.75 despite lower number of changes and lower level of adoption.

Profit implications for wholesalers and DIFM stores: In the markets where Eco7 was set at the full price, the DIFM installers who understood how to pitch Eco7 had no problem selling it. They reported that emphasizing the significant green factor, with no sacrifice in quality, was most important.

4)How should Eco 7 be distributed? What is your recommendation regarding exclusivity for Aventage stores?Distribution Strategy:

Independent DIFM:Fast lubes, oil change–plus stores and repair stores generate 53% of DIFM purchases(Exhibit 1-combined fast lube-32%, oilchange-plus 12% and repair shop 9%) and by selling Eco7 through a wide chain of distributors, the company will reach more final customers and will have higher revenue.

Moreover, the fast lube model helps to drive the consumer shift from DIY to DIFM, often being the first place DIY customers choose among other DIFM installers. Avellin might attract new customers of the growing DIFM segment by offering Eco7 in these stores.

AvellinAuto stores: Penetration of Eco7 will be 95% through these stores, proponent of this approach suggested that working with fewer, but more engaged, stores already in the Aventage program would improve the odds that Eco7 rollout would be executed effectively, but the company still has to be careful and perform less aggressively due to fear of competing with other DIFM chains. Exclusitivity of Aventage stores suggests that working with fewer, but more engaged, stores already in the Aventage program would improve the odds that Eco7 rollout would be executed effectively. Also with prior experience the penetration would grow to 95% with this approach among Aventage stores, which valued exclusivity over a discount
