1. What's the global image of Sony VAIO? DO Chinese 
consumers have additional perceptions of Sony and 
VAIO?  

The aesthetics of it! One of those high-tech computers that were pretty light and high-tech. People who cared about status/style of it as well. 
VAIO had this idea that there were a lot more features that were perhaps unncessary. They also liked the different options of color! \
* PREMIUM OFFERING 
* Software, multimedia stuff
* Sleek
* One of the first movers in the laptop industry
* Not used for entreprises, mostly focused on individuals

For Chinese consumers, they easily saw Sony as a premium brand but were indifferent to the VAIO brand. They saw Sony as a premium cool brand becaues of its numerous colours. More of a status symbol, held japnese brands in high-regard. Aware of sony but not vaio, was seen as young and trendy, prefer knockoff brands and what not


2. Comparing Consumer Interview with CLUES, is there any 
redundancy between two studies? Do the combined 
results of the two studies help Lopez's decision? Answer 
the same questions when comparing Consumer Interview 
with Compass.

They interviewed these people first and what they want and they classifed them.
VAIO viewed the rest of the world with project compass with these six:
6 segements:

1. Technosocializers 
2. Performance Seekers 
3. Status Focused 
4. Unfussy Basics 
5. Functional Socializers 
6. Quality of Lifers 

I feel like the CLUES project was a lot more focused while the Consumer Interview was a lot more vague. Like for example, fashion oriented, business focused, tech enthusiast, and entertainment lover fall underneath an extension of who they are but the consumer interview just saying "an extension of who i am" is a lot more vague than these specific fields. Heavy user falls underneath the "just give me what I want" but a lot more detailed as well. This helps with Lopez's decision because they can narrow down in what they're looking for in customers. Same idea with consumer compass as well such as status focused. Unfussy basics is similar to the "just give me what i want"

- They kinda focus on the behavioural aspect of the two interviews (CLUES vs Consumer Interview)
- CLUES interviews were an extension of the consumer interviews to get much more detailed information.
- VALIDATION and MORE SPECIFIC!
- CLUES get QUANTITATIVE RESULTS on top of qualitative results, CLUES had a much larger sample size
- Cost lots and lots of money to conduct these research
WHO:
People of China for both consumer and clues \
WHAT:
Consumer general what they want, CLUES was specific segmenets \
Outputs:
The grid, CLUES is specific segmenets on the grid \
Redundancy: \
Consumer and CLUES necessary \
Overall Learning:
The general idea for consumer and then specific segements for CLUES \
The combined results don't really help right, the different results from different regions make it hard for people. 

- Consumer interviews with compass were less redundant, consumer interviews with CLUES were both in China and done by lopez while compass were done by Sony itself across many different regions


3. If Lopez's main goal is to steal market share from other 
brands, which study, CLUES or Compass, is more useful? 
Which segment/s should he target? What if his main goal 
changes to focus on existing loyalty and interest in Sony instead of stealing market share? 

Compass would matter more right for a global market, stealing market share, you have more participants which means more segments and brands. He should target large segments in other countries with a focus on what they answered in the compass interview. They talked about like television, computer,
digital camera, DVD player, or personal/home audio system instead of just the VAIO laptop \

If he wants to focus on existing loyalty and interest he should pay more attention to the CLUES interview and focus on the largest segments in China to expand into since there are more users of VAIO in China right

- 1st question:
- Target status focused segment to steal market share so they don't buy knockoffs with a focus on compass

- 2nd Question:
- Target fashion oriented with CLUES survey for LOYALTY!!

THIS IS SO HARD!!!

Answer:\
Exhibit 8: \
You just need to know who's ready to buy a laptop within the next 12 months and go target them!! \
- Compass for loyalty => Focus on the ones that rank sony as their top brands. Status focused people and stuff and technosocializers people!!
- CLUES for stealing market share => Focus on the segments that are prepared to buy a laptop within the next 12 months!!, Entertainment lover and the fashion oriented people
