1. What's the global image of Sony VAIO? DO Chinese 
consumers have additional perceptions of Sony and 
VAIO?  

For Chinese consumers, they easily saw Sony as a premium brand but were indifferent to the VAIO brand. They saw Sony as a premium cool brand becaues of its numerous colours.
The global image of Sony VAIO included 6 segements:

1. Technosocializers 
2. Performance Seekers 
3. Status Focused 
4. Unfussy Basics 
5. Functional Socializers 
6. Quality of Lifers 


2. Comparing Consumer Interview with CLUES, is there any 
redundancy between two studies? Do the combined 
results of the two studies help Lopez's decision? Answer 
the same questions when comparing Consumer Interview 
with Compass.

I feel like the CLUES project was a lot more focused while the Consumer Interview was a lot more vague. Like for example, fashion oriented, business focused, tech enthusiast, and entertainment lover fall underneath an extension of who they are but the consumer interview just saying "an extension of who i am" is a lot more vague than these specific fields. Heavy user falls underneath the "just give me what I want" but a lot more detailed as well. This helps with Lopez's decision because they can narrow down in what they're looking for in customers. Same idea with consumer compass as well such as status focused. Unfussy basics is similar to the "just give me what i want"

3. If Lopez's main goal is to steal market share from other 
brands, which study, CLUES or Compass, is more useful? 
Which segment/s should he target? What if his main goal 
changes to focus on existing loyalty and interest in Sony? 

Compass would matter more right for a global market, you have more participants which means more segments and brands. He should target large segments in other countries with a focus on what they answered in the compass interview. If he wants to focus on exisitng loyalty and interest he should pay more attention to the CLUES interview and focus on the largest segments in China to expand into.
