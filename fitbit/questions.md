1. What competitive advantage does Fitbit possess? 

- A competitive advantage is when a there is a gap between the price buyers are willing to pay for the products/services and the cost it incurs.
- And this gap is wider than the gap the firms' competitors have
- Fitbit had one of the most successful IPO's ever leading to many investory interested in the company, garnishing lots of attention. This led to less incurred costs while the price stayed constant, therefore increasing the gap. 
- Fitbit had many products already in the market, leading to higher revenue generated
- It led the fitness-tracker market in the US with a share of 68%
- They had many outlets for their products like Amazon, BestBuy, Target, and WALMART
- Fire technology


 
2. How has Fitbit segmented their market? 
- First of all, their market was the wearble device market. They segmented their product towards consumers who were interested into fitness!
- Also segemented to customers who were more price-sensitive!

 
3. What advantages do the competitors named in the case 
have in the wearable device market? What other brands 
(not mentioned) have similar advantages that could give 
them the potential to enter the market? 
- Brand loyalty, someone like apple has so many loyal customers lmaoo
- Already established names like samsung, apple, motorolla, nike with their other products.
- Competitors focused on different things but still had Fitbit's main vision as a feature.
- Technological innovation was also an advantage, more R&C's than Fitbit to be able to do so
- More features of the watch than FitBit
 
4. Comparing the positioning strategies adopted by each 
competitor, which strategy do you think will be most 
effective? State any assumptions you are making about 
the market.  
- I think the smartwatch strategy is the most effective. If done correctly, the smartwatch will incoporate fitness features as well as other features making a watch that only does fitness features seem pretty redundant.
