## Question 1

1. Why, historically, has the soft drink industry been so profitable 
for Coke & Pepsi? \

A reason it has been so profitable for both companies is because it does not cost a lot to make Coke & Pepsi drinks. The concentrate producers involved relatively little capital investment in machinery, overhead, or labor. The most significant costs were actually advertising, promotion, market research, and bottler support. This led to huge profit margins as it barely costed anything to make but generated so much revenue due to a vast amount of the population consuming sode drinks as their #1 beverage. Coco cola and Pepsi also focused on sales through numerous different outlets such as restaurants, grocery stores, supermarkets, vending machines, etc. CSD Coke & Pepsi were also very very affordable compaerd to other drinks as well as tasty leading to many consumers to continue buying them. Coke being one of the pioneers of CSD developed automatic fountain disepensers, and vending machines. They marketted Coke as a "lifestyle" and made it very accessible to buy which made its profits shoot up.


## bottler support 
* Bottler support is bottlers purchased concentrate, added carbonated water and high-fructose corn syrup, bottled or canned the resulting CSD product, and delivered it to customer supports. Bottlers were repsonsible for distributing coke but coke helped them regardless
 

## Question 2

### Five forces:
1. New entrants
2. Buyers
3. Suppliers
4. Substitutes 
5. Rivalries and competitve landscape

2. Apply the Five Forces Model, how strong as the industryâ€™s 
competitive forces if you are looking at it from the 
perspective of the bottler?  Is this an attractive industry to 
participate in?

The bottler's of both Pepsi and Coke cannot manufacture bottles for other competing companies wtih similar products. This makes it very difficult for new entrants to the market since these manufacturing companies have already agreed to either Pepsi or Coke
