## Question 1

1. Why, historically, has the soft drink industry been so profitable 
for Coke & Pepsi? \

A reason it has been so profitable for both companies is because it does not cost a lot to make Coke & Pepsi drinks. The concentrate producers involved relatively little capital investment in machinery, overhead, or labor. The most significant costs were actually advertising, promotion, market research, and bottler support. This led to huge profit margins as it barely costed anything to make but generated so much revenue due to a vast amount of the population consuming sode drinks as their #1 beverage. Coco cola and Pepsi also focused on sales through numerous different outlets such as restaurants, grocery stores, supermarkets, vending machines, etc. CSD Coke & Pepsi were also very very affordable compaerd to other drinks as well as tasty leading to many consumers to continue buying them. Coke being one of the pioneers of CSD developed automatic fountain disepensers, and vending machines. They marketted Coke as a "lifestyle" and made it very accessible to buy which made its profits shoot up.

-market strategies
-competition with one another


## bottler support 
* Bottler support is bottlers purchased concentrate, added carbonated water and high-fructose corn syrup, bottled or canned the resulting CSD product, and delivered it to customer supports. Bottlers were repsonsible for distributing coke but coke helped them regardless
 

## Question 2

### Five forces:
1. New entrants
2. Buyers
3. Suppliers
4. Substitutes 
5. Rivalries and competitve landscape

2. Apply the Five Forces Model, how strong as the industryâ€™s 
competitive forces if you are looking at it from the 
perspective of the bottler?  Is this an attractive industry to 
participate in?

Lower forces leads to higher profits. 

The power of suppliers are high. Why should a company choose your company to manufacture their bottles when they can choose the one next door? It is not a very niche task to do and they can choose anyone making the power of your buyers very high since you have to offer satisfactory prices for the companies that want to manufacture prices. The company also determines the syrup price that you must buy to manufacture a beverage in your drink, this doesn't even account for all your labor cost

The bottler's of a company most likely cannot manufacture bottles for other competing companies wtih similar products. This makes it very difficult for new entrants to the market since these manufacturing companies have already agreed to stay loyal to one company, hence the threat of a new entry is very low.
A new entrant has no effect for the bottler since they will be bottling the same companies product anyways.


The threat of substitutes is high. Bottler manufacturing companies can be easily replaced by another manufacturing company since it doesn't take a lot of skill to manufacture some metal cans.


//other bottling industry \
There is rivalry in the bottler industry that can drive prices down and this force up. This force is high since if a company is not satisifed with a bottler and their manufacturing prices they can easily just go on to the next bottler company.

//buyers are retailers **BIG BUYERS != BIG NUMBER OF BUYERS!!!** 

The power of buyers are high. The buyers of the product in the bottle industry would be retail channels. Where to put on the shelf and stuff! The buyers are very large companies and can demand concessions. They also we well-informed about the seller's products as well as switching costs for substitutes are very low!!



This is not an attractive industry to enter. Anybody can do this and it's not very hard to do making the competition, power of buyers, and threat of substitues extremely high making it not a very attractive industry to enter.
 
3.  How can Coke & Pepsi sustain their profits with increasing 
globalization, flattening demand and the growing popularity 
of non-CDS? 

Coke & Pepsi can sustain their profits with increasing globalization because they will have far more customers to sell to. They can give lower prices in poorer countries which will allow many citizens to buy their food since it is so much cheaper. Growing popularity on non-CDS does not have huge effect on these two companies since they own so many other companies anyways. They can use their other products and develop a new non-CDS product that will sell equally as well. In order to flatten demand, they can raise the prices a little bit more which will ultimately make buyers not want to buy their product as much
