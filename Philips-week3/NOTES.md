The numbers at the end, the exhibits are actually important and can help the speed

VRIN (Valuable, Rare, In-imitable, Non-substitutable) INNER ANALYSIS!!

# Prewar:
## Environment: 
* 1892, not saturated

## Strategic decisions:
    * Just Engineer
    * Needed sales person
    * They had a niche product, developed, tungesten filament, research
    * invested in keeping equipment updated
    * diversified
    * great depression, high tarrifs, barriers: local production
    * Moved assests into 2 trusts in america and britain
## Result
    * Early establishement
    * Good at adaption

# PostWar

## Strategic decisions:
    * NOs
        * Freedom to adapt to respective market
        * Maybe too much independnece
    * Internal competition between production and sales (mirrors brother's relationship)
## Result
    * Increased responsiveness
    * International recoginition and presence

# 1960s on

# Environment
    * Japensese competitors were diversifying and coming up with good products
    * Trade barrier and taxes disappeared
        * Competitors moving to low wage areas, phillips did not

## Strategic decisions:
    * Too much independence
    * Couldn't afford international presence
    * Market moved to audio cassests and microwaves
    * 
## Results
    * Low adaptability
    * Non market oriented research and dev
    * NO's costed way too much money
    * disorganized* Low adaptability



## Philips NO's
* The NO's had their own independent R&D and process catered to their local environment's needs
* Trade barriers ended so NO's doesn't rlly make sense, u can just trade and get the money from the parent companies
* They didn't move their companies to lower cost countries!!!
* Good at adapting pre and post war but terrible in the late 1960s!!
* Doing way too many things, economics of scale was pretty bad. A decrease in cost per unit of output enables an increase in scale


# Matushita

## Organizational Foundation

### Environment
* Not many transistor technologies at the time
* Lots of trade liberalization!!
* Pressure from national governments in developing countries

### Strategic Decision
* 250 year plan
* Retail stores
* Each division had their funding, internal competition
* Divisional structure
* Lots of R&D into transistor based technologies and innovation there
* Copying other innovators!!

### Result
* Very organized
* Lots of planning and goals
* Innovational success
* 40% appliance stores!

## Internationalism

### Environment
* People were not a fan of japan (America!!)
* Cost of manufacturing in Japan very very high!
* Trade barriers disappeared!

### Strategic Decision
* Copied VCR's and licenesed and improved it
* Tried to localize companies a lot more, american => americans, chinese => chinese
* Way too much reliance on the Japanese company!!


### Result
* Lots of innovation!

## 1960's and Onwards

### Environment
* International innovation

### Strategic Decision
* Company tried to localize!!
* Manufacture other places


### Result
* Lots of lost profit
* Tied to so much commitement that they did not fire people


## Philips difficulty and what they could have done
* INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GET RID OF NOS MAYBE WORK MORE WITH NOS!!!

## Matsushita difficulty and what they could have done
* USE MONEY GOT FROM COPY CATTING TO INVEST MORE IN R&D in decentralized companies
* Instead of copy catting forever, use that money to innovate!!!
