1. How did Philips become the leading consumer 
electronics company in the world in the postwar era? 
What strategic competence did they build? What 
impediments did these bring? 


Good STRONG R&D but wrong targets, not market oriented
NO took responsibility for almost everything making them almost like their own company.
Something that initially yielded success for Philips were that they had so many national organizations across seas. They were a global brand and were seen almost everywhere. They mimicked the legendary joint technical and commercial leadership of the Phillips brothers. This strategic competence of having both technical and commercial leadership as well as the importance of foreign operations gave them very good management and innovation. However, impediments these same startegies brought were very expensive costs as they had to maintain many manufacturing factories internationally. There was also some divergence for the national organizations from the parent organization which made organization very heavey as well. They would also engineer anything which led to many quick products being created and innovated. This was a strategic competence in the field of innovation, however, it did lead to the company having no vision or strategy which means the company was innovating aimlessly. 

 
2. How was Matsushita able to overtake Philips in over 25 
years? What core strategic competencies gave them a 
competitive advantage? What impediments did these 
bring? 

Good R&D but wrong targets
A strategic competence that they also had was that they outlined a very detailed plan, in fact so detailed it was 250 years in length. However, some impdediments this brought was that the plan was not reactive enough, it did not account for potential risks such as if Japan's economy bubble would break making them not easily adaptable.
Differntiation of their products gave them a competitve advantage. They released transitor radios, TV's, color TV's, dishwashers, and eletric ovens, etc. All of these differntiate their product from what was readily available in industry from phillips, giving consumers a wide varity of products to test and try out. However, they stopped innovating and began to copy and mimic new products which didn't give them much differntiation as time went on. Later on, they fixed this by producing VCRs, giving them number 1 over anyone including Phillips. Their plan on going overseas also gave them more customers to buy from, but like phillips they gained too much independence making it very hard to report back to the parent HQ, making it very difficult to integrate domestic and overseas operations. Japan's economy bubble also broke yielding very bad profits
  
3. Why did both Philips and Matsushita have difficulties 
building the capabilities they recognized as missing?

These two companies both had the problem of expanding so far internationally that they had difficulty reorganizing or communicating with the parent company. They gave way too much freedom to their foreign operations making it very hard if things were going wrong for the parent to reorganize. Too much cost!! R&D not market oriented!!

However, Japan company had to fund the oversea companies, tried to make them local by hiring American companies for Americans. They struggled to decentralize!! SO MUCH OF THE R&D WAS IN JAPAN BUT NOT OFFSHORE!!!! 

Get rid of old traditions and adaptability to be able to adapt quicker.
