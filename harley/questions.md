2. Describe the young adult segment: 
a. Describe the trends, behaviors, and needs/wants of this 
customer group 
b. What is the Young Adult’s current perception of sport 
bikes? 
c. Can HD carve out a credible market position vis-à-vis its 
competitors?  

a. They don't want to belong to the company culture of the old people and stuff, found the experience to the dealership very intimadating. They didn't like the chrome heavy bikes but liked the stripped down, elemental, dark bikes. They enjoyed this apperance more than the chrome heavy bikes. They did not related to the company culutre

b. They found that some Young Adult's thought that sport bikes were physically uncomfortable and constraining, mass produced and lacking in durability with an unapealing sound

c. Maybe with Buell and a rebranding of the business, HD can carve out a credible market position.
 
3. Based on the case, Richer knew “exactly what Harley-
Davidson wanted from its investment in him – a new 
generation of riders and a more diverse customer base, all 
without losing its current customers.”  Where does this fit on 
the Product/Market Expansion Grid? 

This would be a diversification strategy since you have new produces and new markets that you want to enter.
 
4. Which of the five options should Richer and his team choose 
in order to grown Harley’s customer base (stay the course, 
double down on Buell, endorse Buell using the HD brand, 
divest Buell, discontinue the Buell product line)? 
 
Double down on buell and epxand on it probably. Maybe don't want to endorse Buell using HD to not associated the two togetehr

5. Describe your marketing approach from a Product, Place, 
Price and Promotion perspective (i.e. what type of activities, 
initiatives, events, etc. would you invest in) in terms of 
specific tactics that you would use to reinforce your chosen 
positioning 


Product would probably be lighter weight motorcycles and stuff \
Place would probably be at universities or colleges where there are lots of young people \
Price on the cheaper end since young adults are broke \
Promotion with universities or collegses who are willing and promotion events at campuses and what not
