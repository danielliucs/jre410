1. What are Harley-Davidson’s key Value Propositions? \
Their PASSION for customers is one of their value propositions \
The lifestyle of using a harley-davidson motorcycle. Driving a motorcycle from harley-davidson is not only about the motorocycle but is a lifestyle. H-D markets this as a key value proposition. Values and ideals were some things H-D sold as well as motorcycles. \
Product quality heavy-weight bikes good for touring or showing off. \ 
HOG club for just harley groups

tense for action, long hair in the
wind, beards and bandanas flapping, earrings, armpits, chain whips, swastikas and stripped-down
Harleys
 
2. Describe the young adult segment: 
a. Describe the trends, behaviors, and needs/wants of this 
customer group 
b. What is the Young Adult’s current perception of sport 
bikes? 
c. Can HD carve out a credible market position vis-à-vis its 
competitors?  

a. They don't want to belong to the company culture of the old people and stuff, found the experience to the dealership very intimadating. They didn't like the chrome heavy bikes but liked the stripped down, elemental, dark bikes. They enjoyed this apperance more than the chrome heavy bikes. They did not relate to the BOOMER CULTURE \
They liked the culture of this from HD:

(1) a transformational journey, in which riders become who they truly want to be \
(2) a means of escape from a monotonous, constraining life; and \
(3) a way to connect to other like-
minded souls. 14 In that same study, Harley-Davidson found that some Young Adults, including
those who owned sport bikes, characterized sport bikes as constricting and physically
uncomfortable, mass produced and lacking in durability, and having an unappealing sound (“like
sewing machines”). 


b. They found that some Young Adult's thought that sport bikes were physically uncomfortable and constraining, mass produced, and lacking in durability with an unappealing sound

c. Maybe with Buell and a rebranding of the business, HD can carve out a credible market position. \
Don't have to think from buell point of view but from HD, see if buell can help u achieve the goal but don't just go from buell's pov
 
3. Based on the case, Richer knew “exactly what Harley-
Davidson wanted from its investment in him – a new 
generation of riders and a more diverse customer base, all 
without losing its current customers.”  Where does this fit on 
the Product/Market Expansion Grid? 

Market developement since they are selling existing products (motocycles) in new markets, it's just a subset of new motorcycles and stuff. CORRECT!
 
4. Which of the five options should Richer and his team choose 
in order to grown Harley’s customer base (stay the course, 
double down on Buell, endorse Buell using the HD brand, 
divest Buell, discontinue the Buell product line)? 
 
Double down on buell and expand on it probably. Maybe don't want to endorse Buell using HD to not associated the two together. Could also endorse Buell with HD brand and stuff? \

What actually happened was discontinous of the Buell product line... maybe because of the 2008 crisis or the readily substitutes of the japanese brand and stuff

5. Describe your marketing approach from a Product, Place, 
Price and Promotion perspective (i.e. what type of activities, 
initiatives, events, etc. would you invest in) in terms of 
specific tactics that you would use to reinforce your chosen 
positioning 


Product would probably be lighter weight motorcycles and stuff with Buell Bikes\
Place would probably be maybe at like motorcycle RACES and stuff, emerging markets and stuff! 
Place is more like channels, what channels you're going to sell through and stuff (online vs in person) \
Price on the cheaper end since young adults are broke \
Endorse Buell with HD using a big event like motorcycle RACES AND STUFF!
