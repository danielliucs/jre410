1. How attractive is the online personals site industry? 
Complete Porter’s Five Forces in order to determine this. 

The threat of new entrants is high. Anybody can make a dating app, it does'nt cost a lot, doesn't cost a lot to product, all you would need is someone who can code an algorithm, a trusted professional in the field of psychology and then boom you have a dating app. But you would need to have something that differntiates your product.

The threat of substitutes is high, it doesn't cost a lot to switch between products and customer loyalty is not really a thing right, you use it to get a partner and after you're done you leave the app forever. Therefore, someone on a dating app can easily switch to another dating app at low risk, and no cost

The power of buyers is high, customers have to be happy with your app and why it makes it different, without your buyers you have almost nothing

The power of suppliers is low, what would even be the suppliers here? The internet maybe? that's all it takes.

The rivalry is intense between dating apps. The only thing two dating apps will have going for them would be how many successfull relationships are because of them. It's only a numbers game.

It's not a very attractive industry mainly because it is so hard to make profit since they can just use your app without paying. Even if they do pay, they have no customer loyalty to the app if they find a partner. It's easy to be upset at the app too if they dont find a partner. Furthemore, it does'nt cost a lot to swtich between dating apps making a dating app easily replaceable. 
 
2. What is eHarmony’s Competitive Strategy? Why? Is it a 
good strategy given the industry? 

eHarmony's competitive strategy centers on marriage and building serious long-term relationships. They do not cater towards casual hookups or just very short term relationship. Their entire strategy is to build long-term relationships. This is a good strategy given the dating industry since everybody knows that going through a break-up is not very fun and a very painful thing to endure so having the idea of a beautiful loving relatinoship for the long-term is very attractive.
 
3. How does eHarmony’s business proposition and 
membership process support their Competitive Strategy? 

eHarmony has a very extensive introduction questionaire. This gives a first impression that the dating papp product thing is really not something to be tampered with. If you choose to use eHarmony, you are essentially investing your time into finding a serious relationship. You are serious about finding someone special. If you were only looking for casual hookups, you would not bother wasting your time filliong out this beginning questionaire. Their membership process support their competitve strategies as well because if someone was realy serious about finding a serious long term relationship, a couple of dollars for more meaningful conversations/more opportunites to talk with people on the platform doesn't mean anything.

 
4. What is the impact of Chemistry on eHarmony’s 
Competitive advantage?   

Definitely not a good impact! Chemistry had cheaper costs than eHarmony, it had the same goal and aim as eHarmony which can be seen with their questionaire as well, however it was much less exclusive in choosing which members could sign up for their membership making it more accesible to a large broad of people in the market looking for serious relationships. They had a differnet marketing campaign centered on interpersonal chemistry rather than psychosocial compatibility. 


5. Split into groups of five and discuss which of the four 
options you would choose as eHarmony’s next step and 
why

* More interactive platform maybe
* Have like a section for casual hookups and stuff
* Support same sex and relationships!
* Further re-iterate that they are indeed the leading matchmaker
