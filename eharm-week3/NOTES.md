Typically two kinds of network effects

* Cross side network effects
* Same side network effects

* Cross side is the increase in value to users in one side of a network by addition of users to another side (supply and demand sides)
* Same side is the change in value that occurs for users on the same side with the addition of users on that side (supply and demand sides)
